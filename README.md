RagnaRogue is a culmination of past roguelike projects and ideas keeping a familiar name for a new project - hopefully this will be the fun one.

### About

This should contain an "About" eventually.

### Project status
- State: active development
- Playability/Content level: Alpha

### Controls

These controls may or may not be accurate as many things will be changing rapidly at this stage of the project.

### Compiling:

#### Windows:

1. Get git repository
2. Open RagnaRogue-src/RagnaRogue-src.sln in VS2015
3. Build
..* You will need an internet connection to get NuGet dependencies
..* Currently using a pre-compiled version of Microsoft Roslyn for scripting, when NuGet packages for Roslyn work this repository will switch to them
..* If you have trouble compiling see the addendum(s) below

#### Mac/Linux:

Not yet available

#### Compiling Addendum

- xcopy can fail sometimes, don't know why, hitting build/run a second time works

### Contributing

Any of the following methods are perfect
- Write code, create pull request(?), will be reviewed asap
- For bugs/etc open an issue in git

### How the scripting works

Scripting will eventually allow full blown modding, currently it is serving as a simple way to quickly add/modify content.

Essentially the goal is to have as simple of a way to update, balance, add and modify content without having to recompile. This means that content packs, DLC, mods, etc. can all come in a simple form and be quite small.

### Roadmap

The road ahead is unclear, do you choose to press on? [Y/N]
